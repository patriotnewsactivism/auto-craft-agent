## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Maximum Safety:

1. **Let auto-backup run** (it's automatic, just leave it)
2. **Export to ZIP** after completing major work
3. **Push to GitHub** for cloud backup
4. **Don't clear browser data** without exporting first
5. **Keep browser console open** (F12) to see what's happening

### Before Closing Browser:

1. Wait for "Emergency backup created" message (automatic)
2. Or manually export to ZIP
3. Or push to GitHub
4. Your work is already in IndexedDB anyway!
