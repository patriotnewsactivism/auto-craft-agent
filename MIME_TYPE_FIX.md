# MIME Type Error Fix - RESOLVED

## Problem
The app was failing to load with error:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Incorrect Base Path in vite.config.ts
**Problem**: `base: "/auto-craft-agent/"` was causing all assets to be referenced with wrong paths
**Fix**: Removed the base path configuration (defaults to "/" for root deployment)

### 2. ❌ Vercel.json Routing Issue  
**Problem**: Using `rewrites` that redirected ALL requests (including JS/CSS) to index.html
**Fix**: Changed to `routes` with `handle: "filesystem"` to serve static assets correctly

### 3. ❌ Duplicate Configuration Keys
**Problem**: vite.config.ts had duplicate `plugins` and `resolve` keys
**Fix**: Merged into single, correct configuration

## Files Fixed

### vite.config.ts
- Removed `base: "/auto-craft-agent/"`
- Removed duplicate `plugins` and `resolve` keys
- Clean configuration that serves assets from root

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
This ensures static assets are served directly, only HTML routes go to index.html

### public/_redirects
Fixed formatting for proper Netlify/static host compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **If deployed**: Redeploy the app to apply configuration changes
2. **If running locally**: Restart dev server with `npm run dev`
3. **Fresh build**: Run `npm install && npm run build` to create production build

## Why This Works

The key issue was that the server was returning the index.html file for ALL requests, including JavaScript module files. By:
1. Removing the incorrect base path
2. Fixing routing to serve filesystem assets first
3. Ensuring proper configuration syntax

The server now correctly serves JavaScript files as `application/javascript` instead of `text/html`.

## Status: ✅ FIXED

All configuration errors have been corrected. The app should now load properly after redeployment or server restart.
