### Slow Generation
- First generation may take longer (loading patterns)
- Subsequent generations are faster (cached knowledge)
- Complex apps naturally take more time

### Low Quality Scores
- System learns and improves over time
- Provide more detailed descriptions for better results
- Review generated code and provide feedback
