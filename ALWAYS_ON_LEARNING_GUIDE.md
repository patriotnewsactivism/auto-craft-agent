🧠 Recognizes 11+ code patterns
👨‍💻 Thinks like a senior developer
🔍 Performs code reviews
💡 Suggests best practices
```

### 3. Aggressive Learning
```
⏱️ Learning cycle: Every 2 minutes
📊 Learns from: Just 2 tasks minimum
💾 Storage: 100 tasks, 200 patterns locally
🔄 Sync: Automatic to Supabase (if configured)
```

## 📈 Learning Statistics You'll See

```
🧠 Self-learning AI is ALWAYS ACTIVE
📊 Total tasks learned from: 15
✨ Patterns discovered: 23
🎯 Autonomous decisions made: 47
📈 Learning progress: 15 tasks, 23 patterns mastered
```

## 🎓 How It Gets Smarter

1. **Every Command**
   - Analyzes your task
   - Checks similar past tasks
   - Applies learned patterns
   - Uses developer insights

2. **During Execution**
   - Generates code with best practices
   - Auto-validates and corrects
   - Tracks what works

3. **After Completion**
   - Reflects on execution
   - Extracts new patterns
   - Saves locally (instant)
   - Syncs to cloud (background)

## 🔥 New Capabilities

### Pattern Recognition
The AI automatically recognizes:
- React hooks and patterns
- Service layer architecture
- Error handling patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices
- State management patterns

### Code Review
Like a senior developer, it checks for:
- ⚠️ Missing error handling
- 💡 Type safety issues
- 📊 Loading states
- ♿ Accessibility
- ⚡ Performance
- 🧹 Cleanup needs

### Developer Insights
Provides context-aware advice:
- 🏗️ Architecture suggestions
- 🔒 Security recommendations
- ⚡ Performance tips
- 🎯 Best practices

## 💡 What You'll Notice

### First Task:
```
🌱 Early learning phase - try diverse tasks
📚 Each task makes me significantly smarter
```

### After 10 Tasks:
```
🚀 Ready for complex full-stack applications
🎯 Challenge me with enterprise-level features
```

### After 50 Tasks:
```
✨ Expert level - I can autonomously architect entire applications
🔬 Try experimental or innovative project ideas
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Give Detailed Commands
The more context you provide, the better the AI learns:
```
❌ "Create a form"
✅ "Create a user registration form with email, password, validation, and error handling"
```

### 2. Try Diverse Tasks
Help the AI build broad expertise:
- Frontend components
- Backend APIs
- Database operations
- Authentication
- State management
- Testing

### 3. Review AI Insights
Check the insights panel to see:
- What patterns the AI learned
- Success rate trends
- Innovation scores
- Learning progress
