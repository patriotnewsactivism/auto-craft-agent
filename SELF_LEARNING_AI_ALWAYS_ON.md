## 🚀 How It Works

### Learning Flow:
```
User gives command
    ↓
AI analyzes with past patterns
    ↓
Generates code with developer insights
    ↓
Validates and auto-corrects
    ↓
Learns from execution
    ↓
Saves patterns locally (instant)
    ↓
Syncs to Supabase (background, if available)
    ↓
Gets smarter for next task!
```
