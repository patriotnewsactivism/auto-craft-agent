# API Error Fix & Settings Persistence - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Gemini Pro API v1 Beta Error (500 Server Error)**

**Problem:** The `/api/generate` endpoint was only looking for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in server environment variables and never received the API key from user settings stored in localStorage.

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend stored API keys in localStorage via Settings
- Backend API endpoint (`/api/generate.ts`) only checked `process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- The API key was never sent from frontend to backend in requests

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated `/api/generate.ts` to accept `apiKey` parameter in request body
- ✅ Modified `AIService.ts` to send API key with every request
- ✅ API key priority: Request body → Environment variable (fallback)

### 2. **Manual API Key Entry Every Time**

**Problem:** User reported having to manually enter API keys every time.

**Investigation:** Settings component was already correctly saving to localStorage. The real issue was that even with saved keys, the API calls failed because keys weren't being sent to the backend.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed API integration (see above)
- ✅ Enhanced Settings UI to clearly indicate keys persist across sessions
- ✅ Improved toast message to confirm persistence

## Changes Made

### `/api/generate.ts`
```typescript
// Now accepts API key from request body
const { prompt, model: requestedModel, apiKey } = req.body;
const GOOGLE_API_KEY = apiKey || process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;
```

### `/src/lib/aiService.ts`
```typescript
// New method to get API key from localStorage or env
private getApiKey(): string | null {
  return import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY || localStorage.getItem("google_api_key");
}

// Sends API key with every request
body: JSON.stringify({
  model: this.model,
  prompt: prompt,
  apiKey: apiKey, // ← NEW
})
```

### `/src/components/Settings.tsx`
- Enhanced dialog description to clarify automatic persistence
- Improved success toast message

## How It Works Now

1. **User enters API key in Settings** → Saved to `localStorage`
2. **User submits a task** → `AIService` retrieves key from `localStorage`
3. **API request made** → Key is sent in request body to `/api/generate`
4. **Backend uses the key** → Gemini Pro API called successfully
5. **Response returned** → Code generated without errors

## Testing

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All files use consistent API key retrieval pattern
- ✅ `AutonomousAI` and `AutonomousValidator` automatically benefit from fix

## Benefits

1. **No more 500 errors** - API key is properly sent to backend
2. **True persistence** - Keys saved in localStorage work across sessions
3. **Flexible deployment** - Works with or without server environment variables
4. **Better UX** - Clear messaging about persistence in Settings dialog
5. **Automatic integration** - All AI services use the updated `AIService` class

## Next Steps for User

1. Open Settings (⚙️ icon)
2. Enter your Google AI API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
3. Click "Save Keys"
4. Keys will persist - you won't need to re-enter them!
5. Try the Autonomous Code Wizard - it should work without errors now
