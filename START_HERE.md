## ⚡ Test It Now

### Quick Test (No Supabase)
```
Task: "Build a todo app with React and TypeScript"
```

### Autonomous Test (With Supabase)

Run these in sequence:
```
Task 1: "Create a REST API with Express"
Task 2: "Add authentication to API"  
Task 3: "Build REST API with auth"
```

**Task 3 will be better/faster** - the AI learned from Tasks 1 & 2!
