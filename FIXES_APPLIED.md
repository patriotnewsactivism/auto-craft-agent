# Fixes Applied - API Error Resolution

## Date: 2025-10-30

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API 500 Error on `/api/generate`

**Problem:** The API endpoint was returning a 500 status code.

**Root Cause:** Environment variable mismatch between frontend and backend:
- Frontend (Vite) uses `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Backend API (Vercel) needs `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (without VITE_ prefix)

**Solutions Applied:**

1. **Enhanced API Error Handling** (`api/generate.ts`)
   - Added CORS headers for proper frontend communication
   - Improved error messages with helpful hints
   - Added logging to help debug missing environment variables
   - Added support for the `model` parameter from the request body

2. **Improved Frontend Error Handling** (`src/lib/aiService.ts`)
   - Enhanced error messages that display API details and hints
   - Better network error detection and handling
   - Try-catch blocks to handle various error scenarios

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `.env.example` with Vercel deployment notes
   - Enhanced `README.md` with clear deployment instructions
   - Updated `DEPLOYMENT_DEBUG.md` with API 500 error troubleshooting

### 2. Content Script Errors (Browser Extension)

**Note:** The content_script.js errors are from a browser extension (likely a password manager or form filler) and are NOT part of this codebase. These can be safely ignored.

## Required Actions for Deployment

### Vercel Environment Variables

To fix the 500 error on Vercel, you MUST set these environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add the following:
   - **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`** = Your Google AI API key (for server-side API)
   - **`VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`** = Same value (for client-side build)
   - **`VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`** = Your GitHub token (optional, for GitHub features)

3. Redeploy the project for changes to take effect

### Why Two API Key Variables?

- **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`** (no prefix)
  - Used by Vercel serverless functions (`/api/generate`)
  - Server-side only, NOT exposed to browser
  
- **`VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`** (with prefix)
  - Used during Vite build process
  - Injected into client-side code
  - Can be read by `import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Set `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables  
- [ ] Redeploy the application
- [ ] Test API endpoint by submitting a task in the UI
- [ ] Verify no 500 errors in browser console
- [ ] Check that API responses are successful

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. No more 500 errors on `/api/generate`
2. Clear error messages if API key is missing
3. Successful AI code generation when API is properly configured
4. Detailed error messages in console for debugging

## Files Modified

1. `api/generate.ts` - Enhanced error handling and CORS
2. `src/lib/aiService.ts` - Improved error messages and handling
3. `.env.example` - Added deployment notes
4. `README.md` - Enhanced deployment instructions
5. `DEPLOYMENT_DEBUG.md` - Added API error troubleshooting

## Additional Notes

- The content_script.js errors are from a browser extension and can be ignored
- Make sure to redeploy after setting environment variables
- Check Vercel deployment logs if issues persist
- API key should be kept secret and never committed to the repository
