## API Reference

### Setting Model Programmatically

```typescript
import { AIService } from '@/lib/aiService';

// Use specific model
const aiService = new AIService('gemini-2.5-pro');

// Use saved model preference (default)
const aiService = new AIService();

// Change model dynamically
aiService.setModel('gemini-2.5-flash-lite');
```

### Getting Model Information

```typescript
import { getModel, getAllModels, recommendModel } from '@/lib/geminiModels';

// Get specific model info
const modelInfo = getModel('gemini-2.5-pro');
console.log(modelInfo.capabilities);

// Get all available models
const allModels = getAllModels();

// Get recommended model for complexity
const recommended = recommendModel('complex'); // Returns Pro
```

## Migration from Old Models

If you were using older Gemini models:

- `gemini-pro` ‚Üí Use `gemini-2.5-flash` or `gemini-2.5-pro`
- `gemini-1.5-pro` ‚Üí Use `gemini-2.5-pro`
- `gemini-1.5-flash` ‚Üí Use `gemini-2.5-flash`

The 2.5 series provides significant improvements in both speed and quality.
